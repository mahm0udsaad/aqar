‚úÖ Detailed Task Breakdown

1. Search & Filters
	‚Ä¢	Fix status filter logic ("For Sale" vs "For Rent" should return different sets).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure combined filters (type, category, area, price range, etc.) work together.
	‚Ä¢	Add clear loading states without hiding already-loaded images.
	‚Ä¢	Add "Clear all" that truly resets every filter (client noticed confusion).
	‚Ä¢	QA scenarios list (write them): Sale only, Rent only, both, no type, etc.

2. Home Page Visibility
	‚Ä¢	Ensure newly added properties appear in the correct home sections (Latest, Featured).
	‚Ä¢	Respect the "Featured" toggle from Admin ‚Äì verify DB flag & query.
	‚Ä¢	Add manual ordering (drag & drop) for Home sections.
	‚Ä¢	Cache/invalidation: confirm ISR/SSG revalidation so new items show without redeploy.

3. Categories Page
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Display Category name on each card (overlay/label).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add cover image per category (upload field in Admin).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Show property count as "X properties" only when >0; otherwise gray/disabled state.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Optional: add small description tooltip or hover state.

4. Popular Areas Section
	‚Ä¢	Populate results when clicking an area (maps to the correct DB field).
	‚Ä¢	Fix shimmer/placeholder that hides loaded thumbnails (remove overlay after load).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure area filter works with type/category filters combined.
	‚Ä¢	Add empty-state message if no listings.

5. Property Creation / Media
	‚Ä¢	Add explicit image size & aspect ratio hint in the upload UI (e.g., 1200√ó800 px).
	‚Ä¢	Lightbox/Gallery: use larger images than the property page like when i click on the image to display in full screen should be bigger to see the details accuratly .

6. Admin UX Improvements
	‚Ä¢	Add tooltips (titles) to action icons in property list (client can't tell what each icon does).
	‚Ä¢	Enable drag & drop sorting inside each properties like draging the property to be in a diffrent category with drag and drop .
	‚Ä¢	Add drag & drop for Home page featured order.
	‚Ä¢	Add bulk actions (optional) ‚Äì publish/unpublish/delete multiple.

7. SEO & Meta Data
	‚Ä¢	Add dynamic meta tags (title, description, OG) for each Property page.
	‚Ä¢	Add meta tags for each Category/Area page (e.g., "Villa for sale in Maadi ‚Äì 3 floors").
	‚Ä¢	Generate canonical URLs & schema.org (RealEstateListing) where possible.
	‚Ä¢	Create sitemap.xml and update on new property publish.
	‚Ä¢	Robots meta handling for unpublished/draft items.

8. Compare Page Feature
	‚Ä¢	Allow user to select multiple properties (checkbox on cards or "+ Compare" button).
	‚Ä¢	Show comparison table (key attributes side-by-side) on a dedicated page.
	‚Ä¢	Store selections in localStorage or query params.
	‚Ä¢	Clear & share link functionality.

10. Visual / UX Polish
	‚Ä¢	Prevent image flicker by handling skeleton states properly (show skeleton only before load).
	‚Ä¢	Maintain consistent spacing & card heights when data loads.
	‚Ä¢	Improve empty states (no results found, try adjusting filters).
	‚Ä¢	Consider showing category badges on property cards.
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility: Alt text for images, focus states for filters.

	2.	Data rendering issues: Popular Areas, category labels, skeleton flicker.
